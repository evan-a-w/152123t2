Memory!

Alignment:

If we're to access memory of a certain size,
the address has to be divisible by that size.

If we load or store a word from/to memory,
the address has to be a multiple of the size of a word.
address must be divisible by 4

If we store a byte to memory, it can be any address because a byte
is size 1


.align x makes sure the next address is aligned to 2^x
.align 1 makes the next address divisible by 2^1 = 2
.align 2 makes the next address divisible by 2^2 = 4


lw (load word)
sw (store word)


array[i] = array + i * (element size)
