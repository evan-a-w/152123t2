Week 8 monday


FILE *

stdout -- printf writes to stdout
stdin  -- scanf reads from stdin

fprintf
fscanf

printf(...) = fprintf(stdout, ...)
scanf(...) = fscanf(stdin, ...)

fgets - read line from stdin



FILE *fopen("../file.txt", permissions)
permissions:
- "r" read from file
   - fails if the file doesnt exist
- "w" write to a file (from the beginning - replace the contents)
   - creates if not exist
- "a" write to file but from the end (append)
- "w+" or "r+" read and write.
   -  w+ creates it if it doesnt exist

opening a file can fail

we want to handle these errors

commonly we just
- print out an error and end the program


FILE * is a wrapper around an operating system file descriptor, which is just a number
fopen calls the open syscall which will a file descriptor

syscalls:
- read
- open
- write
