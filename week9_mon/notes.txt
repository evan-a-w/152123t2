Permissions:

3 levels of permissions
user (if you are the user that owns the file)
group perm (if you are a member of the group that owns the file)
public (if you're not one of the other groups)


3 things you can do
- read
  - for directories means you can read whats in it
- write
- execute
  - you can cd into it (and read whats in it)


user group public
rwx  rwx   rwx
r-x  ---   ---

only users can read and execute, others have no perms


mode has 9 bits that indicate this stuff

  rwxrwxrwx
0b111111111
0b000000010

  rwxr-x---
0b111101000

hex digit is 4 bits
octal digit is 3 bits

111 = 7
100 = 4
001 = 1


  rwxrwxrwx
0   7  7  7

  rwxr-x---
0   7  5  0


lower order 9 bits of st_mode are these permissions
there are also some bits that indicate some other info like if its a directory

S_ISDIR(st_mode) (true if directory)
